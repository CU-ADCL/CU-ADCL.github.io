You can copy the [markdown source](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/posts/publication-checklist.md) for this page and edit it to keep track of your progress.

## Before Submission

- [ ] Make sure to understand all deadlines including abstract and final submission
- [ ] Overleaf project title should include venue, e.g. ICRA 2024

### (Optional/Conditional)

- [ ] Add entry to the top of [unsubmitted.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/unsubmitted.bib)
    - The entry type should be `@unsubmitted`
    - In the `note` field, add the words "In preparation" and indicate the expected submission date and venue
- [ ] Upload to [arxiv](arxiv.org). Check to see if the venue has any special policies about arxiv.

## After Submission

- [ ] Add new entry to the top of [our-pubs.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/our-pubs.bib):
    - [ ] Add the extra field `note={Under review}`
    - [ ] Add a field annotating which authors are lab members (this helps for proposals). If the first and second authors are students and Zach is the fourth author, you would use `author+an={1=student;2=student;4=zach}`.
    - [ ] Remove old entry from [unsubmitted.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/unsubmitted.bib)

## After Acceptance

- [ ] Update entry in [our-pubs.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/our-pubs.bib) by removing the under/review
- [ ] Add entry to [news.csv](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/_data/news.csv)

## After Final Camera-Ready Submission

- [ ] Update arxiv to match submission and with proper links to the published article.
