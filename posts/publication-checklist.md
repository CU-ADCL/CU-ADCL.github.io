## Pre-Submission Schedule

The schedule below is a target for the weeks leading up to a conference or journal with a deadline on **D-day** (i.e. D-14 indicates 14 days before the deadline). I expect this schedule to be comfortable for an advanced PhD student who already has the initial experiments completed.
New students may want to extend the target times because each of the tasks will take them longer.

This schedule may slip a bit, and this is normal. However, if the schedule slips by 50% (i.e. the D-28 tasks are not completed before D-14), we will call off the submission and wait for the next conference.

### D-28
- [ ] Overleaf created and shared - include the venue in the overleaf project name.
- [ ] All potential co-authors have confirmed that are aware of the paper and have access to overleaf.

### D-21
- [ ] Initial figures and results tables are in the pdf.
- [ ] Literature review is complete (all relevant papers are cited in the pdf, and a brief description of how they relate to the new work is outlined)
- [ ] Section and paragraph-level outline for Dr. Sunberg to initially review. Notify Dr. Sunberg when this is ready and expect review to take 3 days.

### D-14
- [ ] 50% of final text complete
- [ ] Figures are in their final form (minor updates to the data may come after this, but all of the axes, main trends, should stay fixed. The figures should not have any major problems that would prevent publication.)

### D-7
- [ ] Complete draft ready for final review. Notify Dr. Sunberg when this is ready and expect review to take 3 days.

### (Optional/Conditional)

- [ ] Add entry to the top of [unsubmitted.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/unsubmitted.bib)
    - The entry type should be `@unsubmitted`
    - In the `note` field, add the words "In preparation" and indicate the expected submission date and venue
- [ ] Upload to [arxiv](arxiv.org). Check to see if the venue has any special policies about arxiv.

## After Submission

### Before Acceptance

- [ ] Add new entry to the top of [our-pubs.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/our-pubs.bib):
    - [ ] Add the extra field `note={Under review}`
    - [ ] Add a field annotating which authors are lab members (this helps for proposals). If the first and second authors are students and Zach is the fourth author, you would use `author+an={1=student;2=student;4=zach}`.
    - [ ] Remove old entry from [unsubmitted.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/unsubmitted.bib)

### After Acceptance

- [ ] Update entry in [our-pubs.bib](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/bibliography/our-pubs.bib) by removing the under/review
- [ ] Add entry to [news.csv](https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-ADCL.github.io/blob/main/_data/news.csv)

### After Final Camera-Ready Submission

- [ ] Update arxiv to match submission and with proper links to the published article.
