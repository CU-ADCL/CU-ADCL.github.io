The yearly check in is a time for us to review, reflect on, and communicate about your progress through the PhD.

## Slide Deck

In preparation, please reflect on the last year and future and prepare a slide deck or document using the outline below for inspiration (**unless the bullets are marked as required, you do not need to respond to all of them**).

Please **send it to me at least 48 hours before our meeting** so that I can review it.
Note that you can just paste this into slides.com [here](https://adcl.slides.com/tools/markdown-to-presentation) and it will automagically generate the slides so that you can fill them in.
