The yearly check in is a time for us to review, reflect on, and communicate about your progress through the PhD.

## Slide Deck

In preparation, please prepare a slide deck using the outline below and send it to me at least 48 hours before our meeting so that I can review it.

Note that you can just paste this into slides.com [here](https://adcl.slides.com/tools/markdown-to-presentation) and it will automagically generate the slides so that you can fill them in.

```markdown
## Accomplishments in the last year
- Papers submitted and published
- Conferences and workshops attended
- Courses taken
- Internships
- TA/TF positions
- Other activities such as mentoring, reviewing, and outreach
- Anything else that you're proud of

---

## Challenges/disappointments in the last year [OPTIONAL]
- Any challenges that have made it difficult to progress in your PhD that you would like to discuss with me
- Any aspects of your PhD that you feel negative about and would like to discuss with me

---

## Planning for the next year
- What projects do you expect to be working on in the Spring, Summer, and Fall?
- What publications do you expect to submit and when?
- How many classes will you take?
- Do you expect to take on any other significant responsibilities? (Make sure to indicate the relative priorities of this and the items above)
- How do you plan to address any challenges or disappointments you faced in the past year? [OPTIONAL]
- If you could work on any project at all, what would it be like? (is it hardware/computational/theoretical, etc.) (note: it is probably not possible to do this, but I want to optimize as much as possible)

---

## Timeline and requirements
- List of the major PhD requirements from the handbook with indications of which ones you have satisfied (if someone wants to make a list here, please submit a PR, but try to keep things as [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) as possible)
- For the requirements you have not satisfied, when do you intend to satisfy them? (month/year)

---

## Anything else that you'd like to talk about [OPTIONAL]
