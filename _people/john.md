Hi! My name is John and I am a first year M.Sc. student in the Aerospace Engineering Department at CU Boulder. I received my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from CU Boulder in May 2021. My current research broadly deals with validating cyber-physical systems using a reinforcement learning framework known as Adaptive Stress Testing (AST). This work seeks to provide an understanding of where safety-critical systems can slip into a failure regime. Outside of research I enjoy reading and mountain biking!
