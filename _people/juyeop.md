Hola! I am Juyeop. I am a visiting scholar in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at KAIST. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Seoul National University. My main research interest includes the safety of robots and autonomous vehicles with systemic uncertainty. I am also interested in the verification or maximizing robustness of learning-based systems. In my free time, I enjoy workouts and watching movies and dramas. ‘My mister’ is the most favorite drama ever!
