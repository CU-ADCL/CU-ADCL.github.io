Hey! I'm Himanshu. I am a Masters student in the Computer Science department at CU Boulder. Currently, my research interests include - sequential decision making in partially observable environments that have arbitrary uncertainties, autonomous navigation for vehicles and manipulators among dynamic obstacles, and designing continuous action space online POMDP solvers. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar where I designed a multiplayer strategy-based cyber-physical game that helped in improving people's mental health. In my free time I like to explore the beautiful city of Boulder and its neighboring towns on my bike, play basketball, cook delicious Indian curries, read mystery novels, or just watch animes and TV shows!
