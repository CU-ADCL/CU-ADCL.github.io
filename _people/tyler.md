I’m a PhD student at CU Boulder and received my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering at Rutgers University New Brunswick, New Jersey. My research interests lie at the intersection of decision making under uncertainty and game theory. I began my research by investigating POMDP solution methods for finding cost-effective coronavirus testing strategies. Since then, I’ve moved to applying counterfactual regret methods to custody maintenance of adversarial satellites in the space domain awareness field. I’m currently looking into bridging the gap between the deterministic/continuous strategies offered by solutions to differential games and the stochastic/sequential strategies offered by solutions to imperfect information extensive form games.
