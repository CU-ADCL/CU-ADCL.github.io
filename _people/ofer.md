I am a new postdoc at ADCL, starting January 2024. I hold a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering sciences from CU Boulder. Prior to coming to CU Boulder, I worked in an R&D aerospace industry for about 10 years as a research engineer and team leader.
I hold a B.S. degree in aerospace engineering (2010, summa cum laude), and an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering (2015, cum laude), from the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.
My research interests include theory and algorithms for decentralized Bayesian reasoning and decision making under uncertainty in heterogeneous autonomous systems.
