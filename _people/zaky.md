Hi, I'm Zaky. I am a second year M.Sc. student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I received a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering also at CU Boulder. My current research revolves around a couple of projects within the domain of contingency management of UAS under component failures using MPC and POMDP methods. My work aims to solve the problem of optimal recovery of UAS under actuator failures requiring accurate characterization of the fault dynamics. I am also interested in using offline reinforcement learning to determine safe policies for safety-critical systems. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer and shredding the gnar.
