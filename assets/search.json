    "content": "Lab Computing Resources\nAccess\nIn order to access ADCL servers, follow the steps below.\n\n\n  Download and set up CU’s VPN if you haven’t already.\n  Connect to CU’s network via the VPN.\n  ssh into the server, generally with the following syntax: &lt;username&gt;@&lt;server_name&gt;.colorado.edu where &lt;username&gt; and &lt;server_name&gt; are replaced with your username and the name of the server being accessed.\n  Enter your password and use the commandline interface as you would locally.\n\n\nTo setup remote connections in VS Code, complete the above steps if you haven’t already set up remote access and install the Remote-SSH extension and follow the steps here. Note the VPN must be connected to use remote access in VSCode.\n\nSession Management\nUse users to see a list of currrently logged-in users.\n\nUse htop to keep track of which system resources are being used and by whom. This is especially important to avoid running multiple resource intesive processes at once. If there are current procecsses using many resources, check with the owner before starting additional processes to avoid interfering with each other’s processes.\n\nLikewise, before generating or downloading large files, check that there is sufficient space on the machine and move (your) old files to the storage drive as needed to free up space. ncdu is a useful utility for seeing file/folder sizes of the current directory. Run this from /home or the root directory (/) to see additional disk usage information. df (specifically df -h) is useful for viewing disk partition use.\n\nPersisent Sessions\nTmux is useful for keeping remote processes running without requiring an active connection to the server. See this tutorial for more information. Julia in VS Code has documentation on enabling persistent sessions within VS Code with Tmux. Please update the Tmux Session Name field to include your username to avoid naming conflicts. See this forum post for details on how to end a Tmux Julia session in VSCode, as this is different from the usual terminal behavior.\n\nUsing Julia\nJuliaup is a Julia version manager. Installing this in your user folder ensures control over your Julia versions and packages. You may need to edit ~/.profile to ensure the Juliaup path is at the top of the list if you have issues launching Julia with Juliaup.\n\nGithub\nFollow instructions for SSH setup to enable cloning of private repositories.\n",

    "content": "Our research focuses on artificial intelligence for controlling complex systems. We usually focus on autonomous aerospace systems, from space probes to drones to telescopes for tracking space debris, but we have also worked on other systems including ecological communities and autonomous cars. The theme that unites all of our research is uncertainty. This could be uncertainty in the system’s parameters or states or in how other people, systems, or the environment will interact with it. We approach our research from many perspectives, ranging from pure mathematical theory to numerical simulation to hardware experiments. The mathematical formalisms that we most often use are the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for stochastic uncertainty, or various game formalisms when the uncertainty is worst case or introduced by other rational agents. One of our most important specialties is developing online tree search algorithms for POMDPs, and we are one of the world’s leading centers of development for this approach.\n\nThe best way to view our most up-to-date research is to look at our Publications page. Some slides and brief descriptions of some of our projects can be found below. (If you cannot see the slides, make sure to disable all add blockers.)\n\n\n\nApplications and Extensions\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nAutonomous aircraft have the potential to vastly improve our ability to undertake remote sensing tasks such as search and rescue and wildfire monitoring. However, autonomous systems may not have the contextual knowledge that human expert operators have. We’re partnering with the COHRINT Lab to integrate our intelligent POMDP planners with input from an operator to improve search and rescue.\n\n\n\nEcological Navigation\n\n\nEcological management problems often involve navigating from an initial to a desired community state. We showed that navigation between states is an equivalent problem to searching for lowest-cost sequences of actions that comprise direct and shortcut paths. Shortcuts can be obtained by using small sequential abundance perturbations (e.g. low-density introductions) and environment perturbations to nudge communities between states. Our work suggests that brute-force approaches to navigation like antibiotics or clearcutting may have realistic and less impactful alternatives.\n\n\n  Navigation between initial and desired community states using shortcuts, Blonder et al. (2023), In Ecology Letters.\n\n\nBehavior-Aware Autonomous Driving\n\n\n\nIn autonomous driving, there is an inherent tradeoff between safety and efficiency, especially time-efficiency.\nIf a self-driving car is to be perfectly safe, it cannot enter the road, and it can be the fastest if there are no safety constraints.\nThis tradeoff results in the Pareto curves shown in the figure below.\nBut the performance also depends on the model.\nWe showed that by modeling the latent internal states of the other drivers on the road, safety and efficiency can both be simultaneously improved (this corresponds to moving the Pareto curve).\nIn computational tests in a highway driving scenario, internal state modeling allowed the autonomous vehicle to perform a multiple-lane change maneuver nearly twice as fast with the same level of safety.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  ![Highway Lane Change Planning](/assets/images/highway_planning.png)\n\n\n\n  Improving Automated Driving through POMDP Planning with Human Internal States, Sunberg and Kochenderfer (2022), In IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.\n  The Value of Inferring the Internal State of Traffic Participants for Autonomous Freeway Driving, Sunberg et al. (2017), Pre-print.\n\n\nAutonomous Autorotation\n\nIn 2013, Professor Sunberg (as an MS student) and collaborators used autorotation to repeatedly successfully land a small autonomous helicopter without power.\nThe video below contains footage of one of the landings from a nose-mounted camera.\nNote that the pilot releases control as he turns off the motor.\n\n\n\n\n  A Real-Time Expert Control System For Helicopter Autorotation, Sunberg et al. (2015), In Journal of the American Helicopter Society.\n\n\nTheoretical Foundations\nOptimality of POMDP Approximations\n\n\nPartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a flexible representation for real-world decision and control problems. However, POMDPs are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when the state and observation spaces are continuous or hybrid, which is often the case for physical systems. We present a general theory characterizing the approximation error of the practically effective particle filtering techniques that many recent online sampling-based POMDP algorithms use.\n\n\n  Optimality Guarantees for Particle Belief Approximation of POMDPs, Lim et al. (2023), Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).\n\n\nPOMDP Algorithms with Theoretical Guarantees\n\n\n\nRecent online sampling-based algorithms that use techniques such as observation likelihood weighting and have shown unprecedented effectiveness in domains with continuous observation and action spaces. This line of work offers theoretical justifications of these techniques, proving that our new algorithms that utilize these techniques will estimate Q-values accurately with high probability and can be made to perform arbitrarily near the optimal solution by increasing computational power.\n\n\n  Voronoi Progressive Widening: Efficient Online Solvers for Continuous State, Action, and Observation POMDPs, Lim et al. (2021), In the proceedings of IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC).\n  Sparse tree search optimality guarantees in POMDPs with continuous observation spaces, Lim et al. (2020), In the proceedings of International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).\n\n\nAlgorithmic Developments\n\nPractical POMDP algorithms\n\n\n\nLeading online partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) solvers such as POMCP and DESPOT can handle continuous state spaces, but they still struggle with continuous action and observation spaces.\nIn fact, it can be shown analytically that they will converge to suboptimal solutions for some POMDPs with continuous action spaces regardless of the amount of computation.\nIn this line of work, we propose novel POMDP algorithms that overcome these problems using techniques such as progressive widening and weighted particle filtering.\n\n\n\nFor example, in the light-dark example above, POMCP (left) cannot decide to localize in the light region, while our new algorithm POMCPOW (right) can, allowing it to hit the target at the origin much more quickly.\n\n\n  Voronoi Progressive Widening: Efficient Online Solvers for Continuous State, Action, and Observation POMDPs, Lim et al.

    "content": "Passive voice and using “we”\n\nIn general, active voice (e.g. “He moved the box.”) is a more direct and easy-to-understand way of writing compared to passive voice (e.g. “The box was moved.”). However, many scientists and engineers use passive voice in their papers. A large portion of scientific papers is devoted to describing what experiments the scientists conducted. Often, the most natural subject of sentences describing these experiments is “we”, referring to the scientists who conducted the experiment and are writing the paper. However, scientists usually want to put the focus on the experiments rather than the experimenters. Thus, many scientists and engineers have adopted a rule that does not allow the use of “we” or “our” in technical writing. Focusing on the science is a good impulse, but unfortunately the easiest way to avoid “we” is to resort to using the passive voice, which makes papers more difficult to understand.\n\nThere is an additional confounding twist in this story: Mathematicians often use “we” in their papers, however they are typically referring to a different group of people than scientists and engineers. Usually, mathematicians seek to lead a reader through a line of reasoning, for example “Since 51 is a product of 3 and 17, we can conclude that it is not prime.” In this case, “we” refers to the author and the reader rather than the people who conducted an experiment. When used in this way “we” has been much more commonly accepted in mathematical writing than the “we” that refers to the authors in scientific writing.\n\nSo, we are left with the question: should we use “we” in sentences describing the experiments that we carry out?\nMy guidance is the following: It is acceptable to use “we” to avoid passive voice. However, whenever practical, writing should focus on the scientific concepts rather than the people writing the paper or doing the work. Here is an example:\n\n\n  Discouraged (passive): “A hyperparameter search was used to determine that 0.001 is the best learning rate.”\n  Discouraged (“We”): “We conducted a hyperparameter search to find that 0.001 is the best learning rate.”\n  Preferred: “A hyperparameter search revealed that the best learning rate is 0.001.”\n\n\n“We” generally does not need to be used in sections such as the background or problem formulation, for example\n\n\n  Discouraged: “We formulated the following POMDP model of the problem:”\n  Preferred: “The following POMDP models the important features of the problem:”\n\n",
