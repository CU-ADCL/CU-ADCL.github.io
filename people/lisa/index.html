<p>Hi, I’m Lisa. I am a PhD student in the Aerospace Engineering Department at CU Boulder. Currently, my research interests include human-autonomy teaming, risk management in partially observable environments with uncertainty, autonomous navigation to minimize risk, and optimizing  human trust of collaborative autonomous systems. Prior to this, I earned a masters degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. I’m co-advised by Allie Hayman in the Bioastronautics focus area and work on trust modeling and prediction.</p>
