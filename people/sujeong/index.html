<p>Hi! I am Su-Jeong. I’m a visiting scholar in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. I’m pursuing a PhD degree in Aerospace Engineering at KAIST. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at Sejong University and Masters in Aerospace Engineering at KAIST in the Laboratory for information and Control System. My research is focused on decision making under uncertainty such as unknown dynamics, partially observable systems, and imperfect/incomplete information. I am currently interested in learning-based methods to deal with uncertainties under game theoretical formulations. In my free time I enjoy cooking delicious Korean foods, singing, and watching dramas.</p>
