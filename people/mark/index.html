<p>Hi I’m Mark!  I’m currently a PhD student in aerospace engineering at CU Boulder.  I received my Bachelors in Aeronautical Engineering from the US Air Force Academy and my Master’s in the same from MIT.  My research will hopefully focus upon better understanding the critical attributes and consequences of explainability in human-autonomy teaming in high-criticality environments.  I am a test pilot in the Air Force with experience mostly in the F-35 and T-38, but have been lucky enough to fly over 20 different types of aircraft over 10 years of flying.  Outside of work, I love getting outdoors hiking, camping, mountain biking, skiing, or playing golf.</p>
