<p>Hello, I’m Will. I am a Master’s student in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences department at CU Boulder. My current research focuses on the development and implementation of online POMDP planners on real-world hardware, using an autonomous ground robot for experimentation. This work aims to accelerate the adoption of these highly-capable decision-making algorithms in aerospace and robotics applications. I completed undergrad at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I studied aerospace engineering and worked on CubeSats. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and visiting museums.</p>
