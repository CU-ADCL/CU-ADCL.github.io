<p>I’m a third-year PhD student at Vanderbilt University, working with ADCL over the summer of 2025 to develop a Julia framework for working with fully continuous, differentiable partially observable multiagent scenarios. At my home lab - the <a href="https://vampir-lab.github.io/">Vanderbilt Mathematical Programming and Intelligent Robotics Lab (VAMPIR)</a> - I build algorithms for imperfect information games in robotics, targeting partially competitive, partially cooperative applications. In the past / on the side, I’ve worked with UAVs for conservation, computer vision in surgical robotics, and machine learning for road maintenance monitoring.</p>

<p>I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Yale University in 2022. In my spare time, I enjoy board games and writing, and I’m an amateur sewist.</p>
