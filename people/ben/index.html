<p>Hi, I’m Ben. I’m currently pursuing my interest in flight as a PhD student in aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I completed my bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at George Fox University, outside Portland, Oregon. My current research interests center around explainable decision making under uncertainty and the development of autonomous systems for safety onboard manned and unmanned aircraft. When I’m not studying or working on research, I like to get outside and bike, rock climb, or play some soccer.</p>
