<p>Hey! My name is Jackson and I’m a Master’s student in the Electrical Engineering department at CU Boulder studying dynamics and controls. I recieved my bachelor’s in Electrical engineering from Washington State University. My current research involves using reinforcement learning to find causes of failure in systems, a method called Adaptive Stress Testing. In my free time I enjoy playing games such as chess and Magic: The Gathering.</p>
