<p>Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the Ann and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department. I earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Texas A&amp;M University and a PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab. Before joining the University of Colorado faculty, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley in the Hybrid Systems Lab. My research is focused on decision making under uncertainty to enable safe and efficient autonomous vehicle operation. My recent research has focused on developing online algorithms for approximately solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and games with continuous or hybrid state, action, and observation spaces. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, trail running (really more like trail slogging), volunteering at my church, and following long Wikipedia rabbit trails.</p>
